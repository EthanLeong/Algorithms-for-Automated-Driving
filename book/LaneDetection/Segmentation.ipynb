    "1. You know what a neural network is and have trained one yourself before\n",
    "2. You know the concept of *semantic segmentation*\n",

    "```{glossary}\n",
    "[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)\n",
    "  For this excellent Stanford course, you can find all the learning material online. The *course notes* are not finished, but you can read the slides when you click on *detailed syllabus*. You probably want to use the version from [2017](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/) because that one includes lecture videos. However, for the exercises, you should use the 2020 version (very similar to 2017), since you can do your programming in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Google Colab lets you use GPUs (expensive hardware necessary for deep learning) for free on Google servers. And even if you do not want to use Colab, the 2020 course has better instructions on working locally (including anaconda). For the exercises in which you can choose between tensorflow and pytorch I recommend you to use pytorch. If you are really eager to return to this course as quickly as you can, you can stop CS231n once you have learned about semantic segmentation.\n",

    "Even if you fulfill **prerequisite 2**, please read this very nice [blog post about semantic segmentation by Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/) (which is heavily based on CS231n). Be sure that you understand the section about dice loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use dice loss for two reasons\n",
    "* Dice loss gives good results even if there is *class imbalance*: The classes in our problem are \"none\", \"left boundary\", and \"right boundary\". Since lane boundaries are pretty thin, most of the pixels in our data set will be labeled \"none\". This means our data set does inhibit *class imbalance*. A loss function like cross-entropy will not work that well, because the model can get a very low loss just by guessing that each pixel is \"none\". This is not possible when using dice loss.\n",
    "* The dice loss is not only a good loss function, but we can also use it as a *metric* since its value is very intuitive."
